Pros
=======
1. In out next app we do not have a lots of component which can be used from component library
2. Copy required component and use inside next app
3. We we need client interaction then we can copy and pest in next app use them like any other normal app
4. If client interaction need to be integrated in any other js app than it can be used as I have tested in react 18 with node 18 version its working file and it will work with static sites as well by importing the build file.
5. In next case we can manually use them in codebase


Cons
====
1. In the term of client interaction need to be updated two places - Perhaps would be okay


Next Process
=====================
In the same way as you have integrated the different type of collar 
Use same process for the cuff as well

Way to achive the process 
=======================
- In blender simply create only collor from the provided model
- Load shirt model in addition to that load cuff model as well. Eg loading collar model
- Follow the same process to customize the cuff such as inner, outer & default 
- Letter on when you have the model you can simply replace the model and update the mesh name 
- Communicate properly with the modler about the case so that they can make in same way as you describe
