Pros
=======
1. In out next app we do not have a lots of component which can be used from component library
2. Copy required component and use inside next app
3. We we need client interaction then we can copy and pest in next app use them like any other normal app
4. If client interaction need to be integrated in any other js app than it can be used as I have tested in react 18 with node 18 version its working file and it will work with static sites as well by importing the build file.
5. In next case we can manually use them in codebase


Cons
====
1. In the term of client interaction need to be updated two places - Perhaps would be okay
