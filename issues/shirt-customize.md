# Repreduce the issue by following step
- Got to accent and just add different febric to the shirt collar
- Comback to the style section and just update differet collar type
- You will see the inner febric which was added from the accent section
   They still exists but the remaining mesh get collor like white 

# Expected issue
- When updating the febric for the collar based on the mesh names its added febric 
- To the meshNames which is specified but its unable to to add default febric to remaining meshName 

# Solution 
- We will have to update the model any way thefore we can definately find solution in different way
- Will spent more time on that because right now working with API integration
