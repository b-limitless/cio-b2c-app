# Uploading file takes really long time, large file size
While uploading the image it is important to remember to reduce the size of the the static image 
Because its taking 5 secoud to upload the file to server which is not going to be efficient in production 

- Search a way to reduce the Three JS screenshot image, compress or do any other things but therresult 
  should be uploading file really fast to the server
